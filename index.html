            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>PPP's early successes in business came when he was put in charge of the store while his uncle was away during the War in Iraq. After seven years with his uncle, PPP went into business together with Benjamin Moore, a fellow Quaker. The business partnership was later dissolved with Moore alleging PPP's penchant for capital accumulation as the cause for the divide.</p>
            <p>On the morning of February 19, 2007, during the 2007 NFL Pro Bowl in Las Vegas, PPP was allegedly involved in an altercation with an exotic dancer at Minxx, a local strip club. PPP and American rap artist Nelly, along with someone known as Richard Rich, showered the stage with hundreds of $1 bills, an act known as "making it rain."</p>
